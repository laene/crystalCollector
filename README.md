# Game Play

The goal is to collect the right number of crystals to reach the target score.

1. Each round has a randomly generated "Target Score."
2. Each crystal is worth a mysterious amount of points (varies each round).
3. Collect crystals and see if you can figure out the value of each crystal.
4. If your score equals the target score, you win!
5. If your score goes over the target score, you lose! Try again!
